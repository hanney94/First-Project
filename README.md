# Project 1 - Portfolio for HTML & CSS
This is a website that I created for my Portfolio. It includes everything an employer or a potential customer/client would need to know about me and my work.
It has all my contact details including links to my most used websites like Facebook, Twitter & LinkedIn.
<br>
I have chosen to use sleek colours and a clean/simple layout as I find this most visually pleasing and easy to navigate. The colours I have used also best reflect my character.
